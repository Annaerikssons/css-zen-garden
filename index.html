			<h1>Can the Weird Web make a comeback in 2020?</h1>
			<p class="preamble">
				Wonderfully odd and quirky creations are returning to the internet.Here,
				Neal Agarwal makes a case for Weird Web 2.0.
			</p>
		</header>
		<main>
			<p>
				Neal Agarwal has been coding since he was ten years old and
				graduatedfrom Virginia Tech with a degree in computer science. He’s
				interested incombining creativity and technology, as you can see in all
				of hisprojects. Here, Neal lays down his argument for web creators
				likehimself to return to a time when digital tools were utilised to
				create awonderfully weird online world.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I was growing up, Flash was all the rage and the web felt like
				adigital Burning Man. This was during the 2000s when the web was
				alandscape where people cultivated their own unique creations. I like
				tocall this the “Weird Web”, a place where internet creators
				expressedthemselves through interactive content, games and experiments.
				It was aplace that brought delight and joy. There were creative tools
				like
				<em>Line Rider</em>
				, interactive visualisations like
				<em>The Scale of the Universe</em>
				, and who could forget bizarre games like
				<em>This is The Only Level</em>
				?
			</p>
			<p>
				But, when Flash slowly died a decade later, the weird web went with
				it.Social media became the 800-pound gorilla that slowly swallowed
				upindependent creators. That said, there are a few trends today that
				giveme hope that the weird web will make a comeback. Not only that, but
				Ithink it’ll be even better this time around.
			</p>
			<p>
				Yet to understand the future and what may be possible in 2020, I
				thinkit’s important to first understand the past. Weird Web 1.0 was
				almostentirely made with Flash, a programme with capabilities ahead of
				itstime. It provided amazing cross-browser functionality,
				animation,graphics and sound. In fact, when Steve Jobs wrote the death
				letter forFlash in 2010,
				<abbr>HTML5</abbr>
				was still lacking in many of theseareas. It took a long time for it to
				catch up, but once it did, itquickly surpassed Flash in performance and
				cross-browser capability. Thedays of opening Internet Explorer 6 and
				sighing at your massacred webpage are (mostly) over.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				“Flash provided a great entry point for beginners, but learning how
				tocreate things for the modern web is a daunting task.”
			</blockquote>
			<h2>Neal Agarwal</h2>
			Because of this, the opportunity to begin Weird Web 2.0 is an exciting
			andplausible one, especially when you compare the modern web to Flash.
			Forone thing, graphics and animation on the modern web are far more
			powerful.Flash was primarily limited to vector graphics, while the modern
			web givescreators direct access to the
			<abbr>GPU</abbr>
			with the WebGL, and theupcoming WebGPU APIs. As a result, beautiful and
			high-performance 3Danimation is now possible on the web.
			<p>
				Another thing the web long struggled with is programmatic sound.Luckily,
				on the modern web, sound is finally a first-class citizen. TheWeb Audio
				API provides everything you could want in a sound API. It evenprovides
				advanced transformations, allowing for the creation ofgenerative music.
				New libraries like React and Vue have also madeinteractive web content
				far easier to produce. Tedious tasks that usedto take a long time in
				vanilla JavaScript are now simple in modern weblibraries. Creators can
				now produce content much faster than everbefore.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the main advantage Flash still maintains over the modern web
				isease-of-use. Flash provided a great entry point for beginner
				animatorsand programmers, and learning how to create things for the
				modern web isa daunting task by comparison. Luckily, no-code tools are
				becoming morepowerful and give those who don’t know how to code the
				ability to createcontent. These tools still have a long way to go but
				have madetremendous progress in the past five years.
			</p>
			<p>
				The technology needed for creatives to bring about the Weird Web 2.0
				isall here. But the content of the future won’t look the same as the
				past.And it shouldn’t either. But what will the content of Weird Web 2.0
				looklike?
			</p>
			<p>
				Let’s start with a trend that is already apparent:
				<abbr>URL</abbr>
				-based multiplayer games. The rise of cloud computingmeans that it has
				never been easier to set up and maintain game servers.
				<abbr>URL</abbr>
				-based multiplayer games are powerful because theyreduce friction for
				getting players into the game. Two great examples ofthis are
				<a href="https://agar.io">Agar.io</a>
				and
				<a href="https://slither.io">Slither.io</a>
				, games where just clicking alink means you’re already in a multiplayer
				game! Some other games takethe
				<abbr>URL</abbr>
				-based aspect even further. Want your friend to joinyour lobby? Just
				send the lobby
				<abbr>URL</abbr>
				. Want to share yourcustom map? Just send the map
				<abbr>URL</abbr>
				.
			</p>
			<p>
				As the web becomes more powerful, creators will also increasingly usethe
				<abbr>HTML</abbr>
				DOM itself to render their games. A great exampleof a DOM game is Cookie
				Clicker. Made by Julien Thiennot, it usesstandard
				<abbr>HTML</abbr>
				tags for the layout and
				<abbr>HTML</abbr>
				canvas for graphics-intensive parts. Now withlibraries like React and
				Vue too, making highly interactive pages hasnever been easier or faster.
				The same technology that powers web appswill power many of the games of
				the future, further blurring the linebetween game and website.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also believe interactive educational content will be a huge part ofthe
				Weird Web 2.0. The self-learning movement has exploded in the pastdecade
				and people are turning to the web to learn and explore newtopics.
				Creators in this area have started making what are termed
				as“explorables”, or interactive educational content. One of my
				favouritepeople in this space right now is Nicky Case, who makes pages
				like TheEvolution of Trust, which teaches the user a concept
				throughinteraction. I suspect there are many people who learn best
				throughguided interaction and don’t yet know it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now that sound on the web is a first-class citizen, Weird Web
				2.0creators can explore interactive music and sound. A great example
				ofthis is MTA.me, which uses the New York subway system to generate
				music.Another project called Soundscape allows you to create your own
				musicand visualises it in a 3D world. These are just two examples and
				there’sstill so much more to explore with sound on the web.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				“Even before it died, Flash creators struggled to make a living.Luckily,
				today they have a lot more tools than before.”
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Two new technologies on the horizon for the web are machine learning
				andAR/VR. Machine learning will bring new capabilities like
				style-transfer,image recognition and natural language processing to the
				web. It’s hardto predict what creators will do with these new abilities,
				but a greatexample is Quick Draw, a game by Google that uses machine
				learning toguess your drawings.
				<abbr>AR</abbr>
				/
				<abbr>VR</abbr>
				on the web is stillin its infancy, but there’s been great progress in
				the past few yearsand there’s even a proposed specification to make a
				<abbr>VR</abbr>
				API for the web.
			</p>
			<p>
				Yet the biggest hurdle towards the success of the Weird Web 2.0 is
				notthe technology, but the ability for creators to get paid. Even before
				itdied, Flash creators struggled to make a living. Luckily, today
				theyhave a lot more tools than before.
			</p>
			<p>
				The main way Flash creators made money was by selling their content
				togame portals. This is problematic, because it vastly limits
				yourleverage as the game portals hold access to your customers
				(theviewers). To anyone thinking of making interactive content on the
				web, Ihighly recommend that you own your content and are
				direct-to-audience.This will give you the highest chance of success,
				because having direct access to your audience allows for more
				monetisation options. Creatorstoday can monetise through Patreon,
				subscriptions and sponsorships, toname just a few, which weren’t easily
				available to Flash creators.

			<h3>
				Two years ago, I created my own little corner of the web:
				<a href="http://neal.fun">neal.fun</a>
				.
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					It’s my playground where I can experiment with different forms
					ofinteractive media.
				</li>
				<li>
					On the site, you can explore the deep sea, spend Bill Gates’ money,
					ortry to draw famous logos from memory.
				</li>
				<li>
					I started making the site just for fun, but I recently decided to
					gofull-time on making things for the site.
				</li>
				<li>
					Being an independent creator will never be easy, but I hope it’s nowat
					least viable.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The reaction to my little corner of the web has given me much hope for
				the future and a possible Weird Web 2.0. I’ve received countlessmessages
				of people telling me it reminded them of the web they grew upwith, the
				web they miss. But even more interestingly, people who didn’tgrow up in
				the Flash era have been telling me they’ve never seen thingslike this
				and that they want more. Something that hasn’t changed is thatpeople
				still love this medium.
			</p>
			<p>
				I’m excited about the next decade of the web. And while nothing is
				evercertain, the weird web appears to be poised for a comeback and I
				hopeyou’ll join me in helping create it. Maybe this time it will
				stickaround.
